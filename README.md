REX
===
This project is to develope a Reasoner for EXpressive description logics.
It inherits the idea of syntactic approximation from the tractable reasoner REL and combines it with a tableau procedure,
attempting to provide efficient, sound, complete, worst case optimal and pay-as-you-go reasoning performance for today's 
ontologies.
